### Workers on Site App
I plan to build an application to allow a business user to add sites that are on their scope of work
and be able to assign workers to a site from a list of workers that allows them to see what workers are assigned to what site.

The overall need of the application is that business owners have a hard time quantifying a job site with the estimation of a proposal,
materials and workers on site.

# React Template

**Use this template to get up and running quickly on projects.**

This is just like the webpack template. Use it, create the repo, connect it to your local and `npm i`.
